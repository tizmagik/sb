✔️ character counter to 150
✔️ Buttons instead of action menu
🔲 Think about the skim-ability of the slug
🔲 Maybe text-diff for updates (instead of wholesale strikethrough) 
✖️ Chain initial dialog into 2: Meta Info (slug*, language, desk, 2 audience) + People (Sender, 2 Readers)

looks good! some copy tweaks:
Desk partner --> Desk Editor
Owner --> News Desk Owner
