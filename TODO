✔️ character counter to 150
✔️ Buttons instead of action menu
🔲 Think about the skim-ability of the slug
🔲 Maybe text-diff for updates (instead of wholesale strikethrough) 
✖️ Chain initial dialog into 2: Meta Info (slug*, language, desk, 2 audience) + People (Sender, 2 Readers)

looks good! some copy tweaks:
Desk partner --> Desk Editor
Owner --> News Desk Owner


x- "Pitch an Alert" -> "Start an Alert Thread"
x- Remove "you can change this later" to each field, just add at the top

x - People Dialog:
x  - Owner, Add "Desk" (to top), Reader(2), Sender
x  - Remove micro-copy

x- Instead of ~(not yet)~ just say new Sender
x- Look at extra whitespace issue


Status:
 - No Approvals, RED
 - 1st approval, YELLOW
 - Sent, GREEN (no buttons)

LATER:
- For a new pitch, if there is language ask the Desk Editor to approve, if there isn't language ask the Desk Editor to add the language (Eric will provide copy)
- If anyone (but the readers) add an approval, have the bot "call out" the readers for approval
